# MERN-FitFlow
## Project Description
FitFlow.io is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application designed to help users efficiently plan and track their workout routines. The app allows users to list exercises, record the load (weight) used, and track the number of repetitions (reps) performed for each exercise.
